# Unity-C-Basic-Random-Dungeon-Adventure
The ‘Unity C Basic Random Dungeon Adventure’ is a C# project that designs a randomly generated ‘rogue-like’ dungeon featuring monsters, treasure, and level progression.  The project builds and expands on the randomly generated dungeon created through Mr. Billy McDaniel’s course, ‘Unity 2D Random Dungeon Generator for a Roguelike Video Game’.

Update 1.01: 2021-06-15

Completed the course and uploaded the project from this course.  My next updates will expand on the project, by added new features and functionality to the project.


Initial commit: 2021-06-14

An empty repository has been created.  Code will be added in the near future once I have completed Mr. McDaniel's course and have time to modify the course material and add new functionality to the game.
